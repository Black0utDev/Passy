# Passy
Simple password generator built in python 3. This script will require you to also have the colorama module for python install onto your system. This can be done via your command prompt and with the following command:

```pip install colorama```

Once you have everything you can now run the script and input your password length you would like and a strong password will be created. I would advise 15+ characters for your password.
